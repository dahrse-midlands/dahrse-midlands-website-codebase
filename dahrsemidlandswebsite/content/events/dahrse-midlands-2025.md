You are [invited to submit a short talk for Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands 2025](https://tinyurl.com/Call-for-Short-Talks) (DAHRSE-Midlands 2025)—a regional event that brings together research software engineers and related professionals, such as digital Research Technical Professionals, working in the digital humanities and arts across the UK Midlands.

Friday 12th September 2025 sees the first edition of the DAHRSE Midlands meeting. 
This year's event is being hosted by the Dr Godwin Yeboah

This year’s inaugural meeting is a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible 
breadth of skills DAHRSEs in the Midlands possess.

## Registration

We didn't want finances to be a barrier to any attendees, and so [the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme) has generously offered support with any travel expenses. People are able to enquire if they would like to take advantage of this help.

## Location and travel

### Location
The meeting will be held at the University of Warwick Library, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL. 
The location is easy to find and we provided additional information as follows:

### Travel

The University provided information for travel to the University of Warwick Library: https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/using/visiting/

#### Train
If you were travelling by train, Coventry is on the West Coast Mainline and serviced by regular trains from London Euston, Birmingham (New Street and International) and Leicester. It was easy to get a taxi or bus from [Coventry Train Station](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/COV/details.html) so you may have had to book a taxi in advance if you prefer not to [walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wHnVyjMho5Y7qAms8). 

Please note that [Canley](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/canley/) and [Tile Hill](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/tile-hill/) train stations do not have taxi ranks. These stations are served by trains from Birmingham, London, Milton Keynes, Coventry, Northampton and Rugby. You could have gotten a bus to us from close to the stations.

#### Bus
If you were travelling by train, there are regular buses from the Coventry rail station, Coventry city centre as well as Leamington Spa. You could have easily gotten taxis from these locations.

The 11 and 12 bus routes may be ideal from Coventry. Both buses call at the Rail Station Bridge stop on Warwick Road; this stop is few minutes walk from Coventry station as shown on [Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NzFK3rVHBS17jQ7f9).

The U1 and U2 buses may be ideal from Leamington Spa. Both services stop at Parish Church Stand B; a seven-minute walk from Leamington Spa station as shown on [Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3oJBDrtKQRPyA8dJ6).

#### Car
If you were travelling by car, is located within the University of Warwick campus. Both [static](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/maps/map_central-campus-september_20204.pdf) and [interactive](https://warwick.ac.uk/maps/) central campus are available from the provided links.

## Further practical information
