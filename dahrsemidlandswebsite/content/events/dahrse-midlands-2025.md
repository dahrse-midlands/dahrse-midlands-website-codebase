Post-Event Update:
The DAHRSE-Midlands workshop originally planned as an in-person event was delivered in a scaled-down online format on 5th November 2025. This adjustment allowed us to maintain the workshop’s core objectives while making participation more accessible for our community. Despite the change in format, the event successfully fostered collaboration and knowledge exchange among attendees.

You are [invited to submit a short talk for Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands 2025](https://tinyurl.com/Call-for-Short-Talks) (DAHRSE-Midlands 2025)—a regional event that brings together research software engineers and related professionals, such as digital Research Technical Professionals, working in the digital humanities and arts across the UK Midlands.

Wednesday 5th November 2025 sees the first edition of the DAHRSE Midlands meeting. 
This year’s event is being hosted by the Dr Godwin Yeboah 
at the University of Warwick’s [Scarman building](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/spaces/scarman/), and is sponsored by [SSI (the Software Sustainability Institute)](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme).

This year’s inaugural meeting is a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible 
breadth of skills DAHRSEs in the Midlands possess.
