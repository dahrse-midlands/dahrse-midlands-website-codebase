In recent years, the integration of digital technologies into the arts and humanities has opened new avenues for research and innovation. One of the key drivers of this transformation is the emergence of Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers (DAHRSEs). These professionals possess a unique blend of technical expertise and a deep understanding of the arts and humanities, making them invaluable assets in the research landscape.

## The Role of DAHRSE in the Midlands

The Midlands region of England, known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant academic community, is an ideal setting for the growth of DAHRSE. These engineers are instrumental in developing and maintaining the digital tools and platforms that facilitate cutting-edge research in the arts and humanities. From developing complex data visualization tools and text mining algorithms to creating sophisticated databases and designing interactive digital exhibits, DAHRSE are at the forefront of technological innovation in this field.

## Enhancing Doctoral Research

The recent announcement by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) that seven higher education institutions (HEIs) in the Midlands will receive Doctoral Landscape Awards is a significant milestone [1]. These awards recognize excellence in arts and humanities research and pave the way for future advancements in these fields. The universities receiving these awards are: 

1. The University of Warwick
2. University of Leicester
3. University of Birmingham
4. University of Nottingham
5. Birmingham City University
6. De Montfort University
7. Coventry University

One crucial aspect that can further enhance the impact of these awards could be the inclusion of Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands (DAHRSE-Midlands) [2] during the training of these future leaders.

## The Potential Impact of DAHRSE-Midlands

Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands (DAHRSE-Midlands) could play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional humanities research and modern digital technologies. They will bring technical expertise to the table, enabling researchers to harness the power of digital tools and methodologies. This integration will be essential for several reasons (but not limited to):

1. **Enhanced Research Capabilities**: DAHRSE-Midlands could provide the technical know-how to develop and maintain complex digital projects. This includes creating databases, developing software for data analysis such as sentiment analysis of historical texts, named entity recognition (NER) to classify entities within texts, and topic modelling to identify main themes within document collections, and building digital archives. Their skills will ensure that humanities researchers can tackle more ambitious projects with greater efficiency and accuracy [3].

2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The presence of DAHRSE-Midlands could foster collaboration between humanities scholars and technical experts. This interdisciplinary approach will lead to innovative research outcomes that would be difficult to achieve in isolation. For instance, digital humanities projects often require expertise in both historical research and software development [4], while digital arts projects may involve collaborations between artists and technologists to create immersive experiences.

3. **Future-Proofing Research**: As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the need for advanced technical competence will become increasingly important. DAHRSE-Midlands will ensure that arts and humanities research remains relevant and can adapt to new technological advancements. This future-proofing will be crucial for maintaining the long-term impact of research funded by the AHRC awards [5].

4. **Training Future Scholars**: By incorporating DAHRSE-Midlands into doctoral programs, universities will equip future scholars with the skills needed to navigate the digital age. This training will not only enhance their research capabilities but also make them more competitive in the job market. Scholars trained in digital humanities and arts will be better prepared to contribute to a wide range of fields, from academia to industry [6].

## Conclusion

The inclusion of Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers (DAHRSEs) in the AHRC-funded doctoral programs could be a forward-thinking strategy that will significantly enhance the technical competence of future scholars. By investing in DAHRSEs, the awarded universities will ensure that their research remains at the cutting edge of both the humanities and digital technology, ultimately leading to more impactful and innovative research outcomes [7].
