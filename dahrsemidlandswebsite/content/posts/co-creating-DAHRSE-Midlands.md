On **5th November 2025**, the **Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers Midlands (DAHRSE Midlands)** community gathered online for its first meeting. The theme **“Co-Creating DAHRSE Midlands: Vision, Voices, and Next Steps”** was all about collaboration, inclusivity, and building momentum for Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineering in the Midlands.

The DAHRSE Midlands community is growing as a collaborative space for Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers (RSEs) across the region. This meeting focused on shaping our shared vision, amplifying voices, and planning actionable next steps to strengthen our network.

This event was proudly supported by the **[Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/)** via their fellowship programme; their commitment to building sustainable software communities made this event possible.

## Highlights from the Talks

### Welcome & Vision Setting
**Godwin Yeboah**, from the University of Warwick and SSI Fellow, introduced the DAHRSE Midlands initiative, outlining its goals, objectives, and early activities. These were further discussed during the community discussion section, where members contributed ideas and feedback.

He also proposed a desktop study titled:

> **“Exploring the Landscape of Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands: A Preliminary Desktop Study and Working Paper.”**

This study aims to explore the institutional landscape of DAHRSEs in the Midlands—mapping where Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers are based, particularly within universities, the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums), and research groups. It will examine their contributions, especially those visible online, and highlight the roles these RSEs play within their respective institutions.

**Working research question:**
> *What is the current landscape of Research Software Engineers in the Digital Arts and Humanities in the Midlands, and how do they contribute to, and impact the field?*

This initiative and the proposed study represent an important step toward understanding and strengthening the role of RSEs in the digital arts and humanities ecosystem.

### Browser Extensions for Accessibility Testing
**Catherine Smith**, from the University of Birmingham and SSI Fellow, demonstrated practical tools for manual accessibility testing of websites—an essential step beyond automated CI tools. Her talk highlighted how browser extensions can help improve accessibility compliance in humanities web projects.

Catherine reminded us why manual accessibility checks matter:

> *“Automated tools can only take you so far—manual checks are essential to check accessibility criteria are being met.”*

She demonstrated browser extensions that make manual accessibility testing easier and more effective, helping humanities web projects ensure that there are no barriers for people interacting with the material and also that they comply with legal standards.

**Tools mentioned:**
- [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/)
- [Silktide](https://silktide.com/toolbar/)
- [A11y-outline](https://github.com/xi/a11y-outline)

### Reuse, Remake, Recycle: Working with Older Mobile Devices
**Iain Emsley**, from the University of Warwick, shared insights from a project using older mobile devices for AI mapping in urban spaces. His discussion raised critical questions about planned obsolescence, sustainability, and policy implications for Digital Humanities hardware projects.

Iain’s talk sparked a fascinating discussion on sustainability and innovation:

> *“Planned obsolescence creates challenges—but it also opens creative possibilities for reusing older hardware.”*

He shared lessons from a project using old mobile phones for artificial intelligence (AI) mapping, raising questions about policy, testing constraints, and the skills needed to keep legacy devices in play.

## Community Discussion: Shaping the Future (Together)
The most dynamic part of the meeting was our open discussion. A clear theme emerged: **start small, grow organically**. Rather than chasing big, shiny ideas, we’re building momentum through doable, repeatable activities that help people connect and share.

### Activities that build connection and skills
- Short talks, lightning demos (tools and techniques), and show‑and‑tells (experiences and insights) to share best practices.
- Informal Teams chats to surface topics and quick wins.
- Resource repositories on our website—starting with practical collections (e.g., accessibility tools) that teams can use immediately.
- Joint seminars with RSE Midlands and participation in external activities led by [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/) and [SocRSE](https://society-rse.org/).

### Growing an inclusive membership
We agreed to refine the **“Join our community”** page so it reflects the breadth of roles in our space—especially those without a formal “RSE” title who still write code, build workflows, or steward research software.

**Guiding questions we’ll feature:**
- Do you work in the GLAM sector and write code?
- Do you work in Digital Arts & Humanities and write some code or work with research software?

We’ll also conduct a desktop study (see above) to understand the regional landscape and publish blogs that share ideas and practice.

### Communication & onboarding
To improve visibility and make joining easier, we’re streamlining our channels and processes:

- [**Mailing list**](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/DAHRSE-MIDLANDS)
- [**Slack channel**](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/C088WTMB1PZ)
- **Joining process:** see landing page - https://dahrse-midlands.github.io
- [**Community website**](https://dahrse-midlands.github.io)
- [**Community logo**](https://x.com/dahrse_midlands/photo)

## What We’re Doing Next
We agreed to:
- Refine communication channels and onboarding to make it easier to connect and participate.
- Iterate on community activities (talks, demos, resource pages) for steady, organic growth.
- Conduct desktop study and publish blog posts that share findings, ideas, and best practices.
